<h1>Transferring items</h1>
<p> This guide will teach you how to move your items from one server to another in the event that the world undergoes a reset, or you are just feeling a bit crowded on the server you are currently on</p>
<h2>Note:</h2>
<p><strong>Before moving your items, please note that chests being stored will be deleted after 12 hours.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Holding too many ME system hard drives in your inventory can corrupt it and staff will be un able to retrieve your items</strong>

<h2>How to transfer your items</h2>
<p><strong>1:</strong>  Pack up all of your items into a chest <strong>(VANNILA OR IRON, NOT DIAMOND)</strong></p>
<p><strong>2:</strong>  While holding a feather in your hand, <strong>shift+right click</strong> the chest you would like to move to the other server. You can continue doing this for multiple chests you would like to move.</p>
<p><strong>3:</strong>  Connect to the server you will be moving to and find a spot for your base</p>
<p><strong>4:</strong>  Obtain a new feather and <strong>right click</strong> on the ground where you want your chest from the other server to be. You can continue doing this for each chest you have stored.
<p>All contents of the chest will remain the same as you had on the old server. However Storage Drawers, Malisis Doors have been known to not transfer properly, so you do so at your own risk.</p>

<h2>ME Hard Disks</h2>
<p1>When moving ME storage disks, holding too many in your inventory at once can cause issues. To get past this problem, no more than <strong>four 64k disks should be held in your inventory at once.</strong>  This means moving them into your chests 4 at a time, and not holding more than 4 in one chest. Distribute your hard drives evenly through multiple chests. If moving a storage disk <strong>larger</strong>  than 64k, only put <strong>ONE</strong>  in each chest.</p>
